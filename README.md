## A game made with AI
I will remake this game later by myself with Unity.
It is similar to balatro, but more pvp ish. 
it also takes inspiration from One Step From Eden.

It is currently on Version 18
I unfortunately have not added the death screen files to the github. when i add it, I will let you know.
