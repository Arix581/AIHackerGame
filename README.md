## A game made with AI
I will remake this game later by myself with Unity.
It is similar to balatro, but more pvp ish. 
it also takes inspiration from One Step From Eden.

It is currently on Version 18
I unfortunately have not added the death screen files to the github. when i add it, I will let you know.

## To play
Click on the virus you want to use and then on the firewall you wish to attack
try and destroy all of the firewalls
add cards to your deck by clicking them
you can multiselect cards to save time

## Pros and Cons Of AI
<strong>Pros:</strong> Ai is really really fast
<strong>Cons:</strong> Ai is sometimes really inefficient. it is also not good at resolving runtime errors. It also slows down the more complicated everything gets. you dont get to problem solve which is the fun part of coding.
